<h3 align="center">Word Popularity Score App</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This is an assignment project for Boopro. The primary objective here was to make a scalable web application 
in Laravel 11 that would search GitHub issues and efficiently calculate a popularity score for any word. The application 
and the underlying MySQL database are designed to support adding new search providers in the future.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project was realised as a `Laravel API` and its main intent was to make a custom way of calculating the popularity score for
a given word. The score is represented by float numbers from 0 to 10 and its calculated 
based on this formula: `(positive_results / total_results) * 10`.
<br/>
<br/>
Positive results represent the total number of occurrences of the `{word} rocks` pattern, where word is the searched word.
Negative results just follow a different pattern, `{word} sucks`. The application is made to use a search provider and its contexts
to look for these positive and negative results and calculate a score based on them. The search provider in this case was GitHub itself
with its `REST API`, and the context was all publicly available GitHub issues, from all public repositories, or from a single repository. 
<br/>
<br/>
The application has one single API `GET route` with two parameters, the first of which is mandatory, and it's the actual word 
that will be searched. The second parameter is an optional platform with a default value of "GitHub" (`/score/{word}/{platform?}`).
<br/>
<br/>
`SearchController` is responsible for handling requests coming in from this route, and it has a couple of fields that are
used throughout the class extensively. It uses an `environment variable` which holds a GitHub access token for authenticating
requests sent to the GitHub REST API from which the app receives its data.
<br/>
<br/>
To not allow any platform parameter values which are not supported on the system, and also minimize human error in validation,
the controller uses the `SearchProviderEnum` to get name constants for all the supported search providers and validate
the parameter value based on that.
<br/>
<br/>
The controller also includes the ability to check whether there are any records for the given word parameter already present
in the database, and `if the data is not too stale`. It checks for this by comparing the time of the search with the updated_at column
and checks if there isn't more than an hour of difference between the two. If the check passes, it retrieves the data straight
from the database `without searching and making network calls again`, significantly reducing the time of execution. Otherwise, 
it has no other option but to search again and try to refresh the data. 
<br/>
<br/>
To aid the controller in working with the different search providers, I've envisioned that a different class will exist
for every new search provider supported, `separating concerns` and `decoupling the code` while following the
`Single Responsibility` and `Open-Closed` SOLID Principles. For the purposes of this assignment, I've added a new App\Services layer
and inside of it created two service classes: `AbstractSearchProviderService` and `GitHubService`.
<br/>
<br/>
An abstract class is provided to be the primary base class for all new search provider classes created in the future. 
It includes some general fields which will probably be needed for all extended classes, and `prescribes two abstract methods`
that all extended classes need to provide an implementation for: search and calcPopularityScore.
<br/>
<br/>
The `GitHubService class` is the place where all the magic happens. It is responsible for handling `REST API network calls`, 
updating database records, and returning scores or messages to the controller. It contains a robust set of methods for encapsulating
and working with the `business logic` of the assignment.
<br/>
<br/>
`Postman` was used heavily for the development purposes of this assignment, and here are two examples of successful executions, 
the first one being with a network call, and the second being loaded from the database:

<!-- DATABASE DESIGN -->
## About The Database

This is the physical design of the database in use:

<img src="public/assets/images/database-design.png" alt="Database" width="826"/>

In this image we see the four tables that enable storing and querying search results. The `contexts table` serves to distinguish
between the different possible 'contexts' or 'spaces' our search results could reside in. It's created with the idea of supporting
multiple different providers, and multiple different context repositories within those providers, hence the columns `type, 
owner_username and name`, which are all nullable fields.
<br/>
<br/>
The `searches table` has a composite primary key comprised of four columns: `word_id, context_id, count_pages and items_per_page`.
It consists of four columns because that's where all the data that uniquely defines a 'search' is residing. The results may
vary drastically if we reduce or increase the number of pages or even the number of items per every page received. Word_id and
context_id also have foreign key constraints on them.

<!-- AFTER CLONING -->
## How To Kick-Start The Project

Here's a list of things you should check before trying to run the app:
<ul>
    <li>clone the repo using git clone</li>
    <li>run composer install to install dependencies</li>
    <li>give a correct name for the database in the ENV file (mine was boopro-assignment)</li>
    <li>run php artisan migrate:fresh â€”seed to create the DB and seed it with providers</li>
    <li>add an access token in the ENV file</li>
    <li>run php artisan serve</li>
    <li>open Postman, enter the route URL and send a GET request</li>
</ul>
